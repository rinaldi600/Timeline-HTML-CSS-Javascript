                                JavaScript is a scripting language that is one of the three core
                                languages used to develop websites. Whereas HTML and CSS give a
                                website structure and style, JavaScript lets you add functionality and behaviors
                                to your website, allowing your website’s visitors to interact with content in many imaginative ways.

                                JavaScript is primarily a client-side language, meaning it
                                runs on your computer within your browser. However,
                                more recently the introduction of Node.js has allowed JavaScript to also execute code on servers.

                                Since its release, JavaScript has surpassed Java, Flash, and other languages because
                                it is relatively easy to learn, has a free and open community, and, most importantly,
                                is incredibly useful, allowing developers to quickly create apps with audiences in the millions.

                                The early to mid-1990s was an important time for the internet. Key players
                                like Netscape and Microsoft were in the midst of browser wars,
                                with Netscape’s Navigator and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer going head to head.
